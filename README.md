# TestTaskStar

# You need to make one html/php file, which at first start has a form that consists of two fields. Type of month, and the number of stars. In this case, the button to increase the stars should be made as three separate elements (+ button, - button, the input field itself). The month type is a toggle button. Examples of these buttons are attached in the photos to this message. After sending the POST form to the same page, the form should disappear, and the screen should display the moon and the number of stars that were specified before. The moon is either in the shape of the letter C or just a circle. It is forbidden to use drawings. Everything must be created on pure css (overlaying stars on the moon does not need to be validated, but the z-index of the star must be higher). No biolibraries (js / css / php) can be used.
# The number of stars cannot be negative. And can not be more than 100. 
# A star is just a circle. 
# The moon is either a big circle, or the letter C or as in the picture.
